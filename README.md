# Simple Expense Tracker App

This is a basic expense tracker application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add, edit, delete, and track your expenses along with the category.

## HTML Features

- **Form (`<form>`):** Used to create an input form for adding new expenses.
- **Input Fields (`<input type="text">`, `<input type="number">`, `<input type="date">`):** Used for entering expense details like name, amount, and date.
- **Select Dropdown (`<select>`):** Provides a dropdown menu for selecting expense categories.
- **Unordered List (`<ul>`):** Used to display the list of added expenses.
- **List Items (`<li>`):** Represents individual expenses within the list.
- **Buttons (`<button>`):** Triggers actions like adding, editing, and deleting expenses.
- **Div Containers (`<div>`):** Used to structure the layout and content of the application.

## CSS Features

- **Background Images:** Background images are applied to the body and various elements for visual styling.
- **Flexbox:** Flexbox is used extensively for creating flexible and responsive layouts, particularly within the form and expense list items.
- **Font Styling:** Custom fonts are imported from Google Fonts to enhance the application's appearance.
- **Hover Effects:** Subtle hover effects are added to buttons for better user interaction.
- **Media Queries:** Responsive design is implemented using media queries to ensure the application looks good on different screen sizes.

## JavaScript Features

- **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is used to interact with the HTML elements, dynamically update content, and handle user interactions.
- **Local Storage:** Expense data is stored locally in the browser's local storage to persist the data between sessions.
- **Event Listeners:** Event listeners are attached to the form for adding new expenses and to the edit/delete buttons for modifying existing expenses.
- **Array Methods:** Array methods like `push()`, `forEach()`, `splice()`, and `reduce()` are used for managing the expense data.
- **Template Literals:** Template literals are used for creating dynamic HTML content for the expense list items.

## Functionality
